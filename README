# mgotools

This tool suite is the spiritual successor to [mtools](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools),
a series of python libraries designed to quickly parse and summarize
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) log files.

## Structure
The structure of mgotools is designed around a hierarchical approach to
simply adding new inputs, outputs, and commands.

```
main()
   command factory
      input interpreter
         command exec
            parser
               object generation
```
